- right click on the destination directory
- click on "Download All"
- a new input window will appear
- throw the website link in it (the usual suspects are supported, if you have a fancy site feel free to build a lua script)
- click okay
- wait until it's finished (keep in mind, atm some websites will not show a progress-bar)


For some websites the explorer will try to find out what kind of item is affected by the mod, this information will be inserted in the Metadata of the cache
